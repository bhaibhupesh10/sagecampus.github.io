       <p align="left"> Indore is Central Indiaâ€™s biggest city and commercial powerhouse has much more of a cosmopolitan buzz than anywhere else in this region. This is the reason Indore is recognized as the second commercial capital of the country after Mumbai. Apart from some splendid buildings created by the Holkar dynasty, there is a good number of modern commercial buildings and hubs. Its bustling bazaars, good eating scene and a better-than-average crop of hotels, Indore is a place you may well grow to like if you spend your student life.</p>
